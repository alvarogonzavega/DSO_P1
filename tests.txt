Conditions to check proper functionality of the implemented policies. Might not be complete.

-- RR.c --

1 Threads properly swap every QUANTUM_TICKS every time
2 Thread finishes exactly after execution ticks and swaps to the next thread (doesnt wait for next slice)
3 Threads swap in order
4 Threads added during execution of others doesnt interfere and are run after at their turn

-- RRS.c --

1 High priority threads get executed first always and in SJF order
2 H->H -- High priority threads added in between of the execution of a longer high priority thread, substitutes it after its addition. In other case, they get executed at their turn
3 H->L -- A high priority thread added during the execution of a low one, substitutes it at the moment of creation and resets its tick value
4 Ejected threads of high priority preserve their remaining ticks which is used to determine its order
* Low priority threads alone run following the conditions in RR.c

-- RRSD.c --
1 Create only one high priority thread that calls read_disk once with other low priority threads. Waits for disk_interrupt and then inmediately resumes
2 Create two low level priority threads that call read_disk one before the other. Call two simultaneous read_disks. Threads then should wait for their turn
3 Create two threads that call read_disk. Running thread should be "idle" until one disk_interrumpt arrives.
* Threads that dont call read_disk work as RRS.c
